        Twenty One Pilots (stylized in all lowercase, as twenty øne piløts, or
        twenty | one | pilots) are an American musical duo from Columbus, Ohio.
        Initially a band, the group was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist Tyler
        Joseph along with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih, who both left in 2011.
        Since their departure, the line-up has consisted of Joseph and drummer
        Josh Dun. The duo is best known for their singles "Stressed Out",
        "Ride", and "Heathens". The group received a Grammy Award for Best Pop
        Duo/Group Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards for "Stressed
        Out". The band independently released two albums, Twenty One Pilots
        (2009) and Regional at Best (2011), before being signed by record label
        Fueled by Ramen in 2012. Their label debut, Vessel, was released in 2013
        and became the second album in history on which every track received at
        least a gold certification, making Twenty One Pilots the first band in
        the history of music to see every song on two albums earn gold or
        platinum awards.

        The duo achieved breakthrough success with their fourth album,
        Blurryface (2015), which produced the successful singles "Stressed Out"
        and "Ride" and became the first album on which every track received at
        least a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of
        America. The release of the single "Heathens" also made the group the
        first alternative artist in history to have two concurrent top five
        singles in the Billboard Hot 100 and the third rock act in history to
        have two singles simultaneously chart in the top five of the Billboard
        Hot 100, joining the Beatles and Elvis Presley.The duo have released six
        studio albums in total, with the latest being Scaled and Icy, released
        on May 21, 2021. They have also garnered ten No. 1 songs on the
        Alternative Songs chart, making them the artist with the fourth-most
        number-one songs on the chart, just below Linkin Park.

      Tyler Joseph first met future bandmate Nick Thomas at a young age while
      playing youth basketball in Columbus, Ohio.Thomas later transferred to
      Joseph's middle school, and the two would remain friends throughout high
      school.Joseph began playing music after finding an old keyboard inside his
      closet, a Christmas gift he received from his mother, and began mimicking
      radio melodies.In 2007, Joseph released a solo EP, No Phun Intended, in
      his parents' basement. Thomas contributed guitar to several songs on the
      album, and collaborated with Joseph on the track "Trees", which would
      later become a signature Twenty One Pilots song. While attending Ohio
      State University, Joseph met Texas-born future bandmate Chris Salih at a
      party. Noting the songwriter's talent and creative energy, Salih consulted
      Joseph about starting a band. Impressed by the recording studio Salih had
      built in his house, Joseph agreed to play music together and began sharing
      his ideas for new music. Just before their first performance, Joseph
      invited Thomas to join the unnamed band as a bassist. In 2009, the group
      moved into a house of their own, where their first album was
      conceptualized and recorded in the basement.The band initially played for
      a wide variety of audiences at clubs and venues around the Columbus area.
      Playing at metal, hardcore, and electronic venues influenced Joseph to
      incorporate these disparate styles into his songwriting. To catch the
      attention of unfamiliar or disinterested attendees and promoters, the band
      began to experiment with costumes and on-stage acrobatics.Now going by the
      name Twenty One Pilots, the group released their debut, self-titled album,
      Twenty One Pilots, on December 29, 2009, and began touring Ohio. Their
      initial marketing was grassroots; Joseph's mother would stand outside of
      Ohio State University, giving away tickets to their shows. During this
      time, the band participated in various "Battle of the Band" contests at
      The Alrosa Villa and The Basement, important Columbus music venues. In
      2010, the band posted two tracks to their SoundCloud account, a cover of
      "Jar of Hearts" by Christina Perri and "Time to Say Goodbye", an original
      song that samples "Con te partirò" by Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman.
      The latter track would become the first song that local drummer Josh Dun
      heard from the group. Joseph, Dun,and Salih participated in musical
      efforts of a Columbus, Ohio, church Five14. They contributed to four of
      fourteen tracks for their album Clear, with Travis Whittaker and the
      gospel rock band "New Albany Music." In 2011, Joseph appeared in a
      three-part video called "The (moderately inspiring tale of the) Longboard
      Rodeo Tango", and sang "O come, O come, Emmanuel" in another video,
      Christmas With the Stars.
